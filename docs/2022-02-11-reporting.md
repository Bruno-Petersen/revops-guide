  Thank you for taking the time to make and share this theme; it's fantastic.

I'm trying to follow your instructions for Customization and it says:

To customize your site’s aesthetic, open _sass/custom/custom.scss in your editor to see if there is a variable that you can override.

How do you open specific scss files if the theme is installed as a gem? I'm working locally right now so I have a vendor/bundle folder that contains the gems, but obviously editing those files won't persist once I deploy.

- Systems design

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require("./lang/" + l);
  return true;
};
```

<!-- {% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
