# Questions

What makes a good question?

Being good at asking questions is crucial when working in revenue operations.

Some of the reasons we ask questions are to...
...understand something more deeply.
...figure out the exact requirements for a project.
...empathize and build relationships with others.
...help others come to their own conclusions.
...challenge our own or others' assumptions.
...solicit feedback.

But asking good questions is surprisingly difficult.
There are some common pitfalls we can try to avoid.

## Common pitfalls when asking questions

- Asking Closed questions when an open question would be better “is it”, “does it..”
- Question stacking: “So, how much testing has been done? I mean, do we really have all the bugs identified? Yeah, I just really think it’s important to know that — are we good to go?” (try to avoid “and” in questions)
- Not leaving enough silence after a good question that got the other person thinking - try to leave at least 7 seconds
- Leading questions: “Have you thought about the needs of the client?”
- Why questions: “Why would you want to do that?”
- Dirty questions: “Do you have the courage to stand up to them?”
- Binary questions: “Are we good to launch?” “Will it work?” “Is it safe?”
- Self-affirming questions: “We’re good to launch, right?” “Does that make sense?”
- Aggressive questioning: Straight to “What should we do?”
- "Double-tap" Asking a great open question, and while the other person is thinking, asking a closed question to fill the silence.
- Telling instead of asking (e.g. giving a prospect an overview of Funnel without first asking what they know about Funnel) -> see [David Marquet Know, Don't tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op4E6Zp-K8o)
- Interrupting others to probe further or answer a partly formed question/objection, let them finish before coming back to something that you want to dig deeper on. This can also take the form of being too ready to talk and jumping in at any pause in speech
- “Saving face” Glossing over things that the other person says that weren’t clear instead of seeking to clarify
- Answering your question or giving suggestions to your question
