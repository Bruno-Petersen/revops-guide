# Questions

What makes a good question?

Being good at asking questions is crucial when working in revenue operations.

Some of the reasons we ask questions are to...  
...understand something more deeply.  
...figure out the exact requirements for a project.  
...empathize and build relationships with others.  
...help others come to their own conclusions.  
...challenge our own or others' assumptions.  
...solicit feedback.

But asking good questions is surprisingly difficult.
There are some common pitfalls we can try to avoid.

## Common pitfalls when asking questions

- Asking _closed questions_ when an open question would be better.
  Closed questions that can be answered with yes or no are useful to frame the conversation.
  Open questions are useful when trying to understand someone elses position.
  "Does that make sense?" invites the answer "Yes".
  Whereas "What questions do you have?" opens room for discussion.

- _Self-affirming questions_. These are a subset of closed questions, they invite only one response. Examples are “We’re ready to turn on the new automation, right?” “Does that make sense?”. Questions of this kind have the answer baked in and invite no argument. Confirming a decision with self-affirming questions will likely lead to problems and doubt later on if a decision was reached prematurely.

- _Binary questions_. Another subset of closed questions they invite one of two responses. While self-affirming questions misrepresent the space of possible answers by only implying one possible answer, binary questions imply two possible answers. Examples are: “Are we ready to turn on the new automation?” “Will it work?” “Is it safe?”. In most situations there are more than two options and using binary questions can lead to false confidence in a decision through a false sense of agreement. A good alternative to binary questions is using a scale of values. "How ready are we to turn on the new automation?" "How confident are we that this will work?" You can make the question more explicit by explaining the scale e.g. "On a scale from 0 to 5 where 0 means 'not at all' and 5 means 'I trust this with my life'". A second alternative to binary questions is assuming that there are unidentified issues. That way you can turn "Is it safe?" into "What safety concerns do we have?".

- _Question stacking_. This is asking several questions in a row which usually results in the easiest or the last question being answered. For example: "So, how are our leads performing? Has the conversion rate gone up? Does that mean that our new coaching initiative is working and should we roll out the new training to other teams?". I find this happens most often when I am nervous or I haven't thought through or written down my questions in advance of an important conversation. A simple rule of thumb can be to only ask one question at a time. Another recommendation is to avoid the word "and" in questions.

- _Double-tap_. This is similar to to question stacking. Asking a great open question, and while the other person is thinking, asking a closed question to fill the silence.

- Not leaving enough silence after a good question that got the other person thinking - try to leave at least 7 seconds. If you're not leaving enough silence after a question you are effectively question stacking again. Leaving a pause can be uncomfortable at the beginning. Resist the urge to fill the silence.

- _Leading questions_: “Have you thought the effect this might have on our sales cycle?”. Leading questions suggest a conclusion without outright stating it. They are useful when guiding someone to a conclusion you want them to reach. If you intend to truly understand what someone is thinking they get in the way.

- _Why questions_: “Why would you want to do that?” The word "why" has an accusatory ring to it. Asking why is a way to put others on the defensive. Rather than asking why try asking what, how, where. You can ask for the same information while not sounding confrontational. Note that it is tempting to use leading questions when replacing why. "Why would you want to do that?" becomes "What led you to that conclusion?".

- _Dirty questions_: “Do you have the courage to stand up to them?”

- _Aggressive questioning_: Straight to “What should we do?”

- Telling instead of asking (e.g. giving a prospect an overview of Funnel without first asking what they know about Funnel) -> see [David Marquet Know, Don't tell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op4E6Zp-K8o)
- Interrupting others to probe further or answer a partly formed question/objection, let them finish before coming back to something that you want to dig deeper on. This can also take the form of being too ready to talk and jumping in at any pause in speech
- “Saving face” Glossing over things that the other person says that weren’t clear instead of seeking to clarify
- Answering your question or giving suggestions to your question
