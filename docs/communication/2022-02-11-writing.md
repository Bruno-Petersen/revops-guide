# Writing

## Ideas that matter are written down

Ideas that have an *impact* in your daily work are written down. If they haven't yet, they will be soon.
We take notes during meetings, follow up on a conversation or collect our thoughts in writing. We communicate through email, Slack or put text into our presentations. 

We write to explain, clarify, convince, document, and entertain. 
Each written word is intended to be read. This leaves the writer with the responsibility to make those words count. 

Poor writing causes confusion, uncertainty and wastes time. Good writing provides clarity.

These are some of the reasons writing well is important. If you want to make an impact you will need to communicate your ideas in writing and you will want to do so effectively. 

## Basic principles of effective writing 
There are some questions that can be useful to ask yourself when writing:

#### Before writing:
1. What do I want to achieve with this message?
If you are explaining something you will write differently than you would if you are asking a question or making a recommendation. Figure out what you want to say before you start writing. 

2. Is a written message the best way to communicate this? 
While writing is important there are some things better said in person or on the phone. You might bring up a sensitive topic or have to explain something more easily shown or drawn.

#### When writing:
Less is more.

3. Keep sentences short.
Try and stay below 30 words per sentence. You can often replace common phrases with a single word. Tools like Grammarly can be a great help here.
e.g.: the reason why is that -> because

4. Omit needless words.
> Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unneces- sary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts, This requires not that the writer make all sentences short, or avoid all detail and treat subjects only in outline, bUIthat every word tell.
