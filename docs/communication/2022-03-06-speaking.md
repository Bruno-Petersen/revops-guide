# Speaking

This post gives some tips on verbal communication in general and presentations specifically. These points are what I have found useful when working on my speaking skills.

## General Verbal Communication

Giving a presentation is a regular part of working in revenue operations. You present analyses, share new ideas, communicate process changes, motivate change, and more.
Even the best ideas or crucial insights can fail to have an impact when delivered poorly. Improving how you present and speak has a huge impact on being effective in revops.

I have found it most helpful to work on purpose, relevance, brevity, clarity, context, engagement, and understanding.

### Purpose

A clear purpose should be the starting point of any presentation. To identify purpose ask yourself: "What am I trying to achieve?".
Write down your purpose. It gives you the focus to improve clarity and engagement later on. When giving a presentation my purpose might be to convince a colleague of the necessity of reducing technical debt or to help someone understand a piece of automation.

### Relevance

Communication is transactional, though, as the [elements of communication](https://revopsguide.net/communication.html) highlight. The receivers of your message have their purpose and interpretation. Account for that. Ask yourself" "What is in it for them?". If your audience does not care about what you have to say you will struggle to get a point across. In revops presenting something often also comes with a request to others. For example, asking the sales development team to improve their note-taking, or gathering input during a workshop. People expect that information shared with them is relevant to them, otherwise why waste their time and they expect you to know what you need.

[Mark Pollard](https://www.markpollard.net/how-to-make-a-presentation-make-a-point/) created this great Venn-diagram that illustrates this:

### Brevity

Just as with [writing, less is more](https://revopsguide.net/writing.html#while-writing-less-is-more). Making your point briefly can help reduce interference. The fewer things you say the fewer things can be misunderstood. But being brief is subjective it means saying enough to make your point and not more. A pitfall of brevity is losing track of your recipient or their context and saying too little. When explaining a problem to a new colleague you'll use more words than summarising that same problem to a senior executive.

### Context

The context of the communication interaction involves the setting, scene, and expectations of the individuals involved.[^1] We [underestimate the average familiarity](https://xkcd.com/2501/) others have with anything we spent time working on and developing expertise in. The people you talk to might not know what lead scoring is, how your BI-Stack works, or what you have been working on for the last two weeks, for example. To convey your point you will have to provide that context.
I find it helps to ask people how familiar they are with the context, rather than assuming they know more or less than they do. Use [open questions](https://revopsguide.net/questions.html#common-pitfalls-when-asking-questions) such as "How familiar are you with how our lead scoring system works?". Do not judge others. There are plenty of things we don't understand. If people feel like they ought to know what the conversation is about they might not speak up to save face.

### Clarity

Clarity is partly a result of having a purpose for what you are saying. It's hard to be clear when you do not know what you are trying to say.
Ambiguity is the opposite of clarity. To reduce ambiguity tell things as they are. Don't avoid the elephant in the room.[^2]
Ambiguity is also reduced by "building a fence". Define what your idea is not. Do not let people jump to conclusions about what you are saying.

### Engagement

Engaging others during a conversation or presentation makes your idea stick in other peoples minds. It gives you a sense whether people are still listening or whether you lost them somewhere along the way. Engagement is just as much about delivery, as it is about systematically ensuring others are able to follow your point.

1. Passion: Engaging others starts with being passionate about your idea. If you don't care, why should anyone else? Clear purpose helps being passionate.
   If you can get the audience to be passionate too that increases engagement. Do so by demonstrating percieved value to what they already care about.

2. Story: That humans like stories is almost a cliche at this point. But stories work. Making your point part of a larger story makes it memorable. Alternatively provide a small anectdote that illustrates your point. I find it helps to highlight some struggle or tension [^3]

- Cycle the subject: keep saying the same point from different angles, or keep one consistent thread through the talk
- Build a fence: define what your idea is not, do not let people jump to conclusions about your idea
- Verbal punctuation: give people “attachment points” or opportunities “get back on the bus” when they have zoned out, call back to the agenda, discuss the steps, numbers, etc.
- [Ask questions!](https://revopsguide.net/questions.html)

### Understanding

While you present or talk check whether your message came across as intended. Leave

When preparing a formal presentation or speech it is helpful to know that you need about 150 words per minute.
