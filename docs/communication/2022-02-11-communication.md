# Communication

## Communication skills matter

Clearly articulating your point, while presenting, in conversation or writing is a curcial skill regardless of profession.

Excelling at different types of communication is especially valuable in revenue operations, though. The list of areas where these skills matter is long: asking insightful questions helps uncover problems, active listening builds trust with others, presenting the latest analysis informs strategic decisions, and writing a thoughful email or Slack message avoids delays and frustration that come from misunderstandings.

Improving your communication skills is, therfore, one of the best things to work on.

## "Communication" is not a single skill

Improving "communication skills" is a vague recommendation that is hard to take action on. I would therefore recommend working on different aspects of communication separately. That is what helped me most.

Categories of communication that I have found to be useful to distinguis are:

- **Speaking**, both when presenting as well as in regular conversation.
- **Writing** and distinguishing long-form writing from business messages
- Asking **Questions** and understanding requirements
- **Listening** to what others have to say
- Working with multiple **Stakeholders** which adds a strategic dimension to communication
- Using **Visuals** to get your point across

In the following sections I will explore each of these categories.
