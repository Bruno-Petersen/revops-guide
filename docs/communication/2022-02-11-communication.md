# Communication

## Communication skills matter

Clearly articulating your point, while presenting, in conversation or in writing is a crucial skill regardless of profession.

Excelling at different types of communication is especially valuable in revenue operations, though. The list of areas where these skills matter is long: asking insightful questions helps uncover problems, active listening builds trust with others, presenting the latest analysis informs strategic decisions, and writing a thoughtful email or Slack message avoids delays and frustration that come from misunderstandings.

Improving your communication skills is, therefore, one of the best things to work on.

## Different aspects of communication

Improving "communication skills" is a vague recommendation that is hard to take action on. I would therefore recommend working on different aspects of communication separately. That is what helped me most.

Categories of communication that I have found to be useful to distinguish are:

- **[Speaking](https://revopsguide.net/speaking.html)**, both when presenting as well as in regular conversation.
- **[Writing](https://revopsguide.net/writing.html)** and distinguishing long-form writing from business messages
- Asking **[Questions](https://revopsguide.net/questions.html)** and understanding requirements
- **[Listening](https://revopsguide.net/listening.html)** to what others have to say
- Working with multiple **[Stakeholders](https://revopsguide.net/stakeholders.html)** adds a strategic dimension to communication
- Using **[Visuals](https://revopsguide.net/visuals.html)** to get your point across

In the following sections, I will explore each of these categories.
