# Visuals

## Visuals can explain what words cannot
We are so used to the visual display of information that it has become second nature. Using visuals when discussing or communicating ideas can clarify your own thinking and convey these ideas to others. 

In this section we explore the different uses for visualisation in revops and will take a closer look at general principles that are helpful in keeping your visuals clean. 

## Uses for visualisation in Revenue Operations

### Process Documentation



### Decision Trees

### Entity-Relationship Diagrams
Entity-relationship (ER) diagrams describe entites, for example contacts, companies and deals in a CRM, and their relationships.
You may use ER diagrams when reasoning about your CRM and the relationships between objects or when working with relational databases.

[This post by Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/er-diagrams) goes into more detail. 

### Conveying Complex Ideas
### Quick Prototyping and Ideation

### Overusing novel visualisations


## Basic Design Principles
### Color Theory


### Layout and positioning



#### Freemium tools for visualisation
The following are tools I like to use for visualisations (excluding data visualisation).
Each tool is either free or has a capable free tier.
- [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation) for presentations and simple visualisations.
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for light weight ad-hoc visuals. Mostly used as the virtual equivalent of a whiteboard to draw something on. A bit more whimsical.
- [Diagrams](https://www.diagrams.net/) great for process documentation and entity relationship diagrams
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for UI and design work. Great for mockups.
- [Miro](https://miro.com/) very flexible and collaborative tool. Great for workshops, brainstorming and collecting ideas.

As this (and other studies) show: [Learning Styles: Concepts and Evidence Harold Pashler, Mark McDaniel, Doug Rohrer, and Robert Bjork](https://www.trans-pareo.com/uploads/4/5/3/5/4535377/learningstylesstudy.pdf).
