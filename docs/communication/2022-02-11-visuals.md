# Visuals

## Visuals can explain what words cannot

We are so used to the visual display of information that it has become second nature. Using visuals when discussing or communicating ideas can clarify your thinking and convey these ideas to others.

In this section, we explore the different uses for visualization in RevOps and will take a closer look at general principles that help keep your visuals clean.

**SPATIAL REASONING**

## Useful Visualizations in Revenue Operations

### Process Documentation

### Decision Trees

### Entity-Relationship Diagrams

Entity-relationship (ER) diagrams describe entities, for example, contacts, companies, and deals in a CRM, and their relationships.
You may use ER diagrams when reasoning about your CRM and the relationships between objects or when working with relational databases.

Here is a simplified example of what the entity-relationship diagram for HubSpot might be.
![example ER diagram](/assets/img/erd.png)

#### Entities

An entity is an object or concept about which you store information. The entity has a name. You can add the unique identifyer of the entity such as an ID, email or domain. Depending on your use case and how cluttered the visualisation is you might add additional properties that are of particular interest.

#### Relationships

There are different kinds of relationships between entities. You will mostly come across one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.

I find this idea to be the most useful aspect of ER diagrams. The relationship determines how you need to treat data during analysis and what automation you can build.

The picture below shows the six common symbols used when drawing relationships:
![entity relationships](/assets/img/ers.png)

A relationship in an ER diagram consists of two such symbols. One on either end of the relationship. In the CRM example above we saw that companies and contacts have a zero-or-many to zero-or-many relationship. That means a company can exist without any contact associated with it or with one or more contacts associated.

#### Uses of Entity Relationship Diagrams for Revenue Operations

- **Understanding your CRM:** ER Diagrams help understand your CRM. You may, for example, want to build automation that scores leads (contacts) based on metrics of the associated company e.g. employee count, industry, website rank, and technologies used. If the ER diagram tells you that every contact _must_ have an associated company you can build automation on that assumption. If a contact can exist without a company you might need to use other data or create the company relationship first.

- **Visualising assumptions:** Drawing up an ER Diagram can help you and your team a) draw up all the relationships that matter and b) be a starting point to confirm relationships in your systems, be it the CRM or the BI-Stack, are indeed reflected in your understanding of those relationships. Copying data from contacts to companies, for example, will negatively impact data quality if contacts are suddenly

- **Designing systems:** When [designing systems](https://revopsguide.net/design.html) drawing up ER diagrams is a must. Especially when [integrating](https://revopsguide.net/integrations.html) multiple platforms with one another a robust one-to-one relationship will solve _a lot_ of problems. If accounts or customers in one system don't correspond to those in another you will struggle with any meaningful integration.

- **Talking to BI teams:** The RevOps team may not be the team building or maintaining the business intelligence stack[^2]. Other teams such as data engineering, data integration, or business intelligence may do that for you.
  When communicating with these teams ER diagrams can be a valuable tool.

If you're interested in more details on ER diagrams and their history check out [this post by Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/er-diagrams).

### Quick Prototyping and Ideation

Building dashboards or and charts, changing the layout of forms, or modifying what users see in the CRM or support tools are a part of what RevOps teams help with.

The more time consuming any of these is to produce, the more valuable creating early mockups and visualisations becomes. If you are building a dashboard for one of your [stakholders](https://revopsguide.net/stakeholders.html) taking the time to draw what you think they are asking for will save you a lot of time.

Every adjustment you make at this stage saves you from building versions of the the reports that aren't actually useful. It is also a great way for you and the stakeholdes invovled to think through what they are actually asking for.

The image below shows sketches created with Excalidraw. Showing [data visualisation](https://revopsguide.net/visualising-data.html) options to others can help get you to a more useful chart faster and makes creating the charts or dashboard a lot easier later on.

### Conveying Complex Ideas

### Overusing visuals

Using visuals can greatly increase your ability to explain a problem or concept. But there comes a point when visuals get in the way. The goal of visualisation is to reduce the cognitive load for the audience, not increase it.
There are three pitfalls I have commonly run into when using visuals:

1. **Using novel visual language:** If you are very comfortable using visuals in your explanations it is easy to get carried away. Always think about your audience first. Ask yourself how familiar the audience is with the type of visualisation you are using. It can be easy to forget, for example, that many people are not familiar with entity-relationship diagrams. In such a scenario you will find that you need to explain the "visual language" in addition to the point you wanted to make. You have increased cognitive load, not reduced it.

2. **Kill your darlings:** Creating compelling visuals is time-consuming. The longer you spend on a particular visualisation the more attached you will become to it. You also become very familiar with the visualisation and the idea it is trying to convey over that time. This makes it easier to miss that you might be introducing _novel visual language_. Three things help. First, work with quick and rough sketches before committing to creating a pretty visual. Second, ask yourself: "What is this visualisation adding to the story I am trying to tell?", you can ask some of your colleagues for input to see if they get what you mean. Third, be ready to scrap something that does not work. The purpose is to make a point. Visual communication is similar to [writing](https://revopsguide.net/writing.html#basic-principles-of-effective-writing) in this regard.

- analogies
- sensemaking vs. explaining.

## Basic Design Principles

### Color Theory

### Making Space

### Layout and positioning

#### Freemium tools for visualisation

The following are tools I like to use for visualisations (excluding data visualisation).
Each tool is either free or has a capable free tier.

- [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation) for presentations and simple visualisations.
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for light weight ad-hoc visuals. Mostly used as the virtual equivalent of a whiteboard to draw something on. A bit more whimsical.
- [Diagrams](https://www.diagrams.net/) great for process documentation and entity relationship diagrams
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for UI and design work. Great for mockups.
- [Miro](https://miro.com/) very flexible and collaborative tool. Great for workshops, brainstorming and collecting ideas.

As this (and other studies) show: [Learning Styles: Concepts and Evidence Harold Pashler, Mark McDaniel, Doug Rohrer, and Robert Bjork](https://www.trans-pareo.com/uploads/4/5/3/5/4535377/learningstylesstudy.pdf).
[^2]: A "tech stack" is the combination of technologies a company uses to build and run an application or project. Different parts of the organisation can have different stacks e.g. marketing stack, BI stack etc.
