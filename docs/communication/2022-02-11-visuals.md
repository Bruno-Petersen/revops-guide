# Visuals

## Visuals can explain what words cannot
We are so used to the visual display of information that it has become second nature. Using visuals when discussing or communicating ideas can clarify your own thinking and convey these ideas to others. 

In this section we explore the different uses for visualisation in revops and will take a closer look at general principles that are helpful in keeping your visuals clean. 

## Uses for visualisation in Revenue Operations

### Process Documentation



### Decision Trees

### Entity-Relationship Diagrams
Entity-relationship (ER) diagrams describe entites, for example contacts, companies and deals in a CRM, and their relationships.
You may use ER diagrams when reasoning about your CRM and the relationships between objects or when working with relational databases. 

Here is a simplified example of what the entity relationship diagram for HubSpot might be.
![example ER diagram](/assets/img/erd.png)

#### Entities

#### Relationships
There are different kinds of relationships between entities. You will mostly come across ont-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. 

I find this idea to be the most useful aspect of ER diagrams. The relationship determines how you need treat data during analysis and what automation you can build. 

The picture below shows the six common symbols. 
![entity relationships](/assets/img/symbols.png)

A relationship in an ER diagram consits of two such symbols. One on either end of the relationship. In the CRM example above we saw that companies and contacts have a zero-or-many to zero-or-many relationship. That means a company can exist without any contact associated to it or with one or more contacts associated. 



#### When ER Diagrams are useful
- Understanding your CRM
- Clarifying relationships
- Visualising assumptions
- 
- Talking to BI teams

### Conveying Complex Ideas
### Quick Prototyping and Ideation

### Overusing novel visualisations


## Basic Design Principles
### Color Theory


### Layout and positioning



#### Freemium tools for visualisation
The following are tools I like to use for visualisations (excluding data visualisation).
Each tool is either free or has a capable free tier.
- [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation) for presentations and simple visualisations.
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for light weight ad-hoc visuals. Mostly used as the virtual equivalent of a whiteboard to draw something on. A bit more whimsical.
- [Diagrams](https://www.diagrams.net/) great for process documentation and entity relationship diagrams
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for UI and design work. Great for mockups.
- [Miro](https://miro.com/) very flexible and collaborative tool. Great for workshops, brainstorming and collecting ideas.
