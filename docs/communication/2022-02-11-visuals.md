# Visuals

## Visuals can explain what words cannot
We are so used to the visual display of information that it has become second nature. Using visuals when discussing or communicating ideas can clarify your own thinking and convey these ideas to others. 

In this section we explore the different uses for visualisation in revops and will take a closer look at general principles that are helpful in keeping your visuals clean. 

## Uses for visualisation in Revenue Operations

### Process Documentation



### Decision Trees

### Entity-Relationship Diagrams
Entity-relationship (ER) diagrams describe entites, for example contacts, companies and deals in a CRM, and their relationships.
You may use ER diagrams when reasoning about your CRM and the relationships between objects or when working with relational databases. 

Here is a simplified example of what the entity relationship diagram for HubSpot might be.
![example ER diagram](/assets/img/erd.png)

#### Entities

#### Relationships
There are different kinds of relationships between entities. You will mostly come across ont-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. 

I find this idea to be the most useful aspect of ER diagrams. The relationship determines how you need treat data during analysis and what automation you can build. 

The picture below shows the six common symbols used when drawing relationships: 
![entity relationships](/assets/img/ers.png)

A relationship in an ER diagram consits of two such symbols. One on either end of the relationship. In the CRM example above we saw that companies and contacts have a zero-or-many to zero-or-many relationship. That means a company can exist without any contact associated to it or with one or more contacts associated. 

#### When ER Diagrams are useful
- Understanding your CRM: ER Diagrams help understand your CRM. You may, for example, want to build automation that scores leads (contacts) based on metrics of the associated company e.g. employee count, industy, website rank, and technologies used. If the ER diagram tells you that every contact *must* have an associated company you can build automation on that assumption. If a contact can exist without a company you might need to use other data or create the company relationship first. 

- Visualising assumptions: Drawing up an ER Diagram can help you and your team a) draw up all the relationships that matter and b) be a starting point to confirm relationships in your systems, be it the CRM or the BI-Stack, are indeed reflect you understanding of those relationships. Copying data from contacts to companies, for example, will negatively impact data quality if contacts are suddenly 

- Designing systems: When [designing systems](https://revopsguide.net/design.html) drawing up ER diagrams is a must. Especially when [integrating](https://revopsguide.net/integrations.html) multiple platforms with one another a robust one-to-one relationship will solve *a lot* of problems. If accounts or customers in one system don't correspond to those in another you will struggle with any meaningful integration. 

- Talking to BI teams: The RevOps team may not be the team building or maintaining the business intellingence stack[^2]. Other teams such as data engineering, data integraion, or business intellingence may do that for you. 
When communicating with these teams ER diagrams can be a valuable tool.

#### Freemium tools for visualisation
The following are tools I like to use for visualisations (excluding data visualisation).
Each tool is either free or has a capable free tier.
- [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation) for presentations and simple visualisations.
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for light weight ad-hoc visuals. Mostly used as the virtual equivalent of a whiteboard to draw something on. A bit more whimsical.
- [Diagrams](https://www.diagrams.net/) great for process documentation and entity relationship diagrams
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for UI and design work. Great for mockups.
- [Miro](https://miro.com/) very flexible and collaborative tool. Great for workshops, brainstorming and collecting ideas.

As this (and other studies) show: [Learning Styles: Concepts and Evidence Harold Pashler, Mark McDaniel, Doug Rohrer, and Robert Bjork](https://www.trans-pareo.com/uploads/4/5/3/5/4535377/learningstylesstudy.pdf).

[^2]: A "tech stack" is the combination of technologies a company uses to build and run an application or project. Different parts of the organisation can have different stacks e.g. marketing stack, BI stack etc.
