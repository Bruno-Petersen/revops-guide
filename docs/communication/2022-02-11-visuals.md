# Visuals

## Visuals can explain what words cannot
We are so used to the visual display of information that it has become second nature. Using visuals when discussing or communicating ideas can clarify your own thinking and convey these ideas to others. 

In this section we explore the different uses for visualisation in revops and will take a closer look at general principles that are helpful in keeping your visuals clean.

#### Freemium tools for visualisation
These are the tools I like to use for most of the visualisations I do outside of data visualisation tools. Each tool is either free or has a very capable free tier.
- [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation) for presentations and simple visualisations.
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for light weight ad-hoc visuals. Mostly used as the virtual equivalent of a whiteboard to draw something on. A bit more whimsical.
- [Diagrams](https://www.diagrams.net/) great for process documentation and entity relationship diagrams
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for UI and design work. Great for mockups.
- [Miro](https://miro.com/) very flexible and collaborative tool. Great for workshops, brainstorming and collecting ideas.
