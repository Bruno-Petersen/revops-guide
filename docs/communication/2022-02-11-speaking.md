# Speaking

Giving a presentation is a regular part of working in revenue operations. You present analyses, share new ideas, communicate process changes, motivate change and more.
Even the best ideas or crucial insights can fail to have an impact when delivered poorly. Improving how you present and speak has a huge impact on being effective in revops.

I have found it most helpful to focus on:

- Relevance
- Brevity
- Clarity
- Engagement
- Alignment
- Understanding
