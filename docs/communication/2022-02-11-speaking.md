# Speaking

This post gives some tips on verbal communication in general and presentations specifically. These points are what I have found useful when working on my speaking skills.

## General Verbal Communication

Giving a presentation is a regular part of working in revenue operations. You present analyses, share new ideas, communicate process changes, motivate change and more.
Even the best ideas or crucial insights can fail to have an impact when delivered poorly. Improving how you present and speak has a huge impact on being effective in revops.

I have found it most helpful to work on purpose, relevance, brevity, clarity, context, engagement, alignment and understanding.

### Purpose

Clear purpose should be the starting point of any presentation. To help identify purpose ask yourself: "What am I trying to achieve?".
Writing down your purpose helps you focus which improves clarity and engagement later on. When giving a presentation my purpose might be to convince a colleague on the necessity of reducing technical debot or to help someone understand a piece of automation.

### Relevance

Communication is transactional, though, as the [elements of communication](https://revopsguide.net/communication.html) highlight. The recievers of your message have their own purpose and interpretation. Account for that. Ask yourself" "What is in it for them?". If your audience does not care about what you have to say you will struggle getting a point across. In revops presenting something often also comes with a request to others. For example asking the sales development team to improve their note-taking, or gathering input during a workshop. People expect that information shared with them is relevant to them, otherwise why waste their time and they expect you to know what you need.

[Mark Pollard](https://www.markpollard.net/how-to-make-a-presentation-make-a-point/) created this great venn-diagram that illustrates this:

### Brevity

Just as with [writing, less is more](https://revopsguide.net/writing.html#while-writing-less-is-more). Making your point briefly can help reduce interference. The fewer things you say the fewer things can be misunderstood. But being brief is subjective it means saying enough to make your point and not more. A pitfall of brevity is losing track of your recipient or their context and saying too little. When explaining a problem to a new colleague you'll use more words than summarising that same problem to a senior executive.

### Context

The context of the communication interaction involves the setting, scene, and expectations of the individuals involved.[^1] We [underestimate the average familiarity](https://xkcd.com/2501/) others have with anything we spent time working on and developing expertise in. The people you talk to might not know what lead scoring is, how your BI-Stack works, or what you have been working on for the last two weeks, for example. To convey your point you will have to provide that context.
I find it helps to just ask people how familiar they are with the context, rather than assuming they know more or less than they actually do. Use [open questions](https://revopsguide.net/questions.html#common-pitfalls-when-asking-questions) such as "How familiar are you with how our lead scoring system works?". Do not judge others. There are plenty of things we don't understand. If peopel feel like they ought to know what the conversation is about they might not speak up to save face.

### Clarity

Clarity is partly a result of having a purpose to what you are saying. It's hard to be clear when you do not know what you are trying to say.
Ambiguity is the opposite of clarity.

- Build a fence: define what your idea is not, do not let people jump to conclusions about your idea

### Engagement

the top thing you can do is be passionate about what you are talking about

- can you show something/ perceived value to get audience passionate too?
- Humans are story based animals, so try to build stories to make your message memorable

- Cycle the subject:, keep saying the same point from different angles, or keep one consistent thread through the talk
- Build a fence: define what your idea is not, do not let people jump to conclusions about your idea
- Verbal punctuation: give people “attachment points” or opportunities “get back on the bus” when they have zoned out, call back to the agenda, discuss the steps, numbers etc.
- [Ask questions!](https://revopsguide.net/questions.html)
  -> receiver, feedback

### Alignment

-> receiver, context

### Understanding

-> feedback

## Preparing a Presentation

### Miscellanous Tips

When preparing a formal presentation or speech it is helpful to know that you need about 150 words per minute.
