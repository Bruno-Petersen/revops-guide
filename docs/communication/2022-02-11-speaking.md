# Speaking

Giving a presentation is a regular part of working in revenue operations. You present analyses, share new ideas, communicate process changes, motivate change and more.
Even the best ideas or crucial insights can fail to have an impact when delivered poorly. Improving how you present and speak has a huge impact on being effective in revops.

I have found it most helpful to work on purpose, relevance, brevity, clarity, context, engagement, alignment and understanding.

### Purpose

Clear purpose should be the starting point of any presentation. To help identify purpose ask yourself: "What am I trying to achieve?".
Writing down your purpose helps you focus which improves clarity and engagement later on. When giving a presentation my purpose might be to update my colleagues on the progress of a project or to help someone understand a piece of autom.

### Relevance

The first

-> receiver
Brevity -> reduce interference
Clarity -> improve message, reduce interference
Engagement -> receiver, feedback
Alignment -> receiver, context
Understanding -> feedback
