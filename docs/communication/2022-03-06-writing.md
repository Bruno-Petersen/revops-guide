# Writing

## Why writing matters

We take notes during meetings, follow up on a conversation or collect our thoughts in writing. We communicate through email, Slack, or put text in our presentations.

We write to explain, clarify, convince, document, and entertain.
Good writing makes each word count.

Poor writing causes confusion, uncertainty and wastes time.
Good writing provides clarity.

These are some of the reasons writing well is important. If you want to make an impact you will need to communicate your ideas in writing and you will want to do so effectively.

## Basic principles of effective writing

#### Before writing: Purpose and Medium

- What do I want to achieve with this message?
  Figure out what you want to say before you start writing.

- Is a written message the best way to communicate this?
  Some things are better said in person or on the phone. You might bring up a sensitive topic or explain something more easily [shown or drawn](https://revopsguide.net/visuals.html).

#### While writing: Less is more

- Keep sentences short.
  Try and stay below 30 words per sentence. You can often replace common phrases with a single word. This helps reduce language complexity.
  Tools like Grammarly can be a great help here.
  For example:

```
the reason why is that -> because
```

- Omit needless words. From elements of style:

  > Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts, This requires not that the writer make all sentences short, or avoid all detail and treat subjects only in outline, but that every word tell. [^1]

- Be specific:
  Write with nouns and verbs, not with adjectives and adverbs. In revenue operations, you can often replace adjectives with data. For example:

```
The number of sales-qualified leads increased significantly.
The number of sales-qualified leads increased by 20% compared to last week from 100 last 120.
```

- Avoid [weasel words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word). There are three common categories here:
  > 1. Numerically vague expressions (for example, "some people", "experts", "many", "evidence suggests")

2. Use of the passive voice to avoid specifying an authority (for example, "it is said")
3. Adverbs that weaken (for example, "often", "probably")

- Get to the point:
  Start with the most what's important. Assume the reader might only read the first one or two sentences means.
  Answer questions directly. Then give additional detail.
  For example:

```
Q: How many sales-qualified leads did the SDR team create last week?
A: The SDR team created 120 SQLs last week. 70 of these were created by the EU team, 50 by our US-based team.
```

- Revise and rewrite:
  It is OK to delete what you have written and start over. Revising is part of writing. Few writers are so expert that they can produce what they are after on the first try.[^1]

## Practical advice in a business environment

Tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams offer features that make your messages easier to digest.
These include:

- Turning lists into numbers or bullet points
- Use emojis to draw attention to important sections.
- Responding to parts of a message by using quotes.

The image below shows two messages.
The first is a "wall of text". Little attention has been paid to making the messages understandable.
Break out sections into paragraphs.

The second example is better. The message has a clear header. A few sentences are broken out at the beginning and the bulk of the messages is broken out in bullet points.

## Learning more

If you are interested in learning more about improving your writing I highly recommend the book _The Elements of Style_ by Strunk, White & Kalman.

Paul Graham also has three good essays about writing:

- [Write Like You Talk](http://www.paulgraham.com/talk.html)
- [How to Write Usefully](http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html)
- [Putting Ideas Into Words](http://www.paulgraham.com/words.html)

### Weasel Words Checker

I use this regex search pattern to find common weasel words in the posts I write here. The list is by no means complete, but it helps me identify common words that reduce the strenght of writing or introduce strange adverbs:
`[\w]*ly\W|some[\w]*|bit|almost|as much|can|could|in a sense|just|many|may|might|most|often|quite|rather|seems|very`
