# Common KPIs

There are many different key performance indicators (KPIs) that are important for SaaS companies to track and monitor. These KPIs can help to provide insights into the health and performance of the business, and can be used to identify areas for improvement or growth.

Here are some of the most important SaaS KPIs, along with a brief explanation of each one:

- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):** This KPI measures the amount of revenue that is generated on a recurring basis from subscription fees, and is a key indicator of the overall health of the business.

- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** This KPI measures the cost of acquiring a new customer, and can help to identify the efficiency of the company's marketing and sales efforts.

- **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):** This KPI measures the total revenue that is generated from a customer over the course of their relationship with the company, and can help to identify opportunities for upselling or cross-selling.

- **Churn rate:** This KPI measures the percentage of customers who cancel their subscription or stop using the company's products or services, and can help to identify areas where the company is losing customers.

- **Net Promoter Score (NPS):** This KPI measures the degree to which customers are likely to recommend the company's products or services to others, and can provide insights into customer satisfaction and loyalty.
