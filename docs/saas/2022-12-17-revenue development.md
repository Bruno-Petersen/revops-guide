## SDRs and BDRs

SDRs and BDRs are both types of revenue development professionals who are responsible for generating leads and helping to move them through the sales funnel. But there are some key differences between the two roles:

- **Scope of responsibilities:** SDRs typically focus on generating leads and qualifying them for the sales team, while BDRs may also be responsible for identifying and pursuing new business opportunities, such as partnerships or strategic alliances.

- **Target audience:** SDRs typically focus on reaching out to individual potential customers, while BDRs may also be responsible for engaging with organizations or other entities.

- **Level of experience:** SDRs are generally entry-level positions, while BDRs may require more experience and may be more senior in the organization.

### Inbound vs. Outbound

Inbound leads are potential customers or partners who have expressed interest in the organization's products or services, either by filling out a form on the company's website or by responding to a marketing campaign. SDRs are usually responsible for following up with these leads, evaluating their fit for the organization's products or services, and determining whether they are ready to be passed on to the sales team for further follow-up.

Outbound activities refer to proactive efforts to identify and pursue new business opportunities, such as by reaching out to potential customers or partners who have not yet expressed interest in the organization's products or services. BDRs are usually responsible for identifying and reaching out to potential customers or partners, as well as for nurturing these leads through the sales funnel. They can also be responsible for identifying and pursuing strategic partnerships or other business opportunities that could benefit the organization.
