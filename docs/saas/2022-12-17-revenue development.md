# Revenue Development

The revenue development functions consists of SDRs (sales development representatives) and BDRs (business development representatives) in a B2B SaaS company their responsibility vary depending on the specific needs and goals of the organization. In general, however, these teams may be responsible for:

- **Generating leads:** SDRs and BDRs may be responsible for identifying and reaching out to potential customers and partners, as well as for nurturing leads through the sales funnel. This may involve using various tactics such as social media, email marketing, and paid advertising to reach the target audience.

- **Qualifying leads:** SDRs and BDRs may be responsible for evaluating the potential fit of a lead for the organization's products or services, and for determining whether the lead is ready to be passed on to the sales team for further follow-up.

- **Collaborating with the sales team:** SDRs and BDRs may work closely with the sales team to identify key prospects, develop strategies for reaching and engaging them, and support the sales team in closing deals.

- **Tracking and reporting on metrics:** SDRs and BDRs may be responsible for tracking and reporting on metrics such as lead generation, lead qualification, and sales pipeline progress.

- **Providing product and market knowledge:** SDRs and BDRs may be responsible for staying up to date on the organization's products and services, as well as on industry trends and competitive landscape, in order to effectively communicate the value proposition to potential customers and partners.

## SDRs and BDRs

SDRs and BDRs are both types of revenue development professionals who are responsible for generating leads and helping to move them through the sales funnel. But there are some key differences between the two roles:

- **Scope of responsibilities:** SDRs typically focus on generating leads and qualifying them for the sales team, while BDRs may also be responsible for identifying and pursuing new business opportunities, such as partnerships or strategic alliances.

- **Target audience:** SDRs typically focus on reaching out to individual potential customers, while BDRs may also be responsible for engaging with organizations or other entities.

- **Level of experience:** SDRs are generally entry-level positions, while BDRs may require more experience and may be more senior in the organization.

SDRs and BDRs play a crucial role in the success of a B2B SaaS company by helping to identify and cultivate relationships with potential customers and partners, and by supporting the sales team in closing deals.

### Inbound vs. Outbound

Inbound leads are potential customers or partners who have expressed interest in the organization's products or services, either by filling out a form on the company's website or by responding to a marketing campaign. SDRs are usually responsible for following up with these leads, evaluating their fit for the organization's products or services, and determining whether they are ready to be passed on to the sales team for further follow-up.

Outbound activities refer to proactive efforts to identify and pursue new business opportunities, such as by reaching out to potential customers or partners who have not yet expressed interest in the organization's products or services. BDRs are usually responsible for identifying and reaching out to potential customers or partners, as well as for nurturing these leads through the sales funnel. They can also be responsible for identifying and pursuing strategic partnerships or other business opportunities that could benefit the organization.

## Difference depending on go-to-market

A two-stage sales process with SDRs and AEs (account executives) is often used in B2B SaaS companies when the average contract value (ACV) is above approx. $10.000 and the sales cycle is longer e.g. above 30 days. In this approach, SDRs are responsible for identifying and qualifying potential opportunities, typically through outbound prospecting. They work to understand the needs of the prospect and determine if there is a fit with the company's offerings. If the opportunity is deemed viable, the SDR will pass it along to an AE, who is responsible for closing the deal.

This approach is effective for high-ACV deals because it allows the AE to focus on more qualified opportunities, rather than spending time on lower-value deals that may not be a good fit for the company. It also helps to ensure that the AE is engaging with prospects that are more likely to convert into customers, which can improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the sales process.

On the other hand, if the ACV is lower (approx. $1.000) or the sales cycle is shorter (<30 days), a one-stage sales process may be more appropriate. In this case, the AE may be responsible for both identifying and qualifying opportunities, as well as closing the deal. This approach can be more efficient and cost-effective for lower-ACV deals, as it allows the AE to move more quickly through the sales process and close deals more quickly.

In some cases, it may be preferable not to involve an SDR in the sales process, especially when dealing with very large ACVs and enterprise buyers. This is often the case when the prospect is looking for a high-level solution and wants to speak with an experienced salesperson who can demonstrate expertise and provide insights into the problem your product is solving. This can help to build trust and credibility with the prospect, which can be especially important in complex, high-value sales situations.

Additionally, an experienced salesperson may be better equipped to handle objections and negotiate the terms of the deal, which can be critical in closing large ACV deals. They may also be able to provide more tailored and personalized support to the prospect, which can be important for building long-term relationships with enterprise customers.
