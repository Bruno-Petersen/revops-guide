# SaaS Glossary

In this glossary, you will find a range of terms commonly used in the SaaS industry, from basic concepts and terminology to more advanced concepts and metrics.

## KPIs

There are many different key performance indicators (KPIs) that are important for SaaS companies to track and monitor. These KPIs can help to provide insights into the health and performance of the business, and can be used to identify areas for improvement or growth.

### Average Contract Value (ACV)

> The average contract value (ACV) is a metric that measures the average revenue generated from a customer over the lifetime of their contract. It is often used to evaluate the performance of a sales team and to benchmark the success of different sales strategies. To calculate the ACV, you divide the total revenue generated from all contracts by the number of contracts.
>
> For example, if a company generates $100,000 in revenue from 10 contracts, the ACV would be $10,000 ($100,000 / 10 contracts). If the company then generates an additional $50,000 in revenue from 5 new contracts, the ACV would increase to $11,000 ($150,000 / 15 contracts).
>
> The ACV can be a useful metric for evaluating the effectiveness of a sales team and for identifying trends in customer demand. It can also be used to compare the performance of different sales teams or sales regions and to benchmark the success of different sales strategies.
>
> It's important to note that the ACV is different from the average selling price ([ASP](https://revopsguide.net/glossary.html#average-sales-price-asp)), which measures the average price of a product or service that is sold. ACV is typically used in B2B (business-to-business) sales, where contracts are typically longer-term and involve a higher value, while [ASP](https://revopsguide.net/glossary.html#average-sales-price-asp) is more commonly used in B2C (business-to-consumer) sales, where transactions are typically smaller and more frequent.

### Average Sales Price ([ASP](https://revopsguide.net/glossary.html#average-sales-price-asp))

The average selling price ([ASP](https://revopsguide.net/glossary.html#average-sales-price-asp)) is a metric that measures the average price of a product or service that is sold. It is often used to evaluate the overall pricing strategy of a company and to identify trends in customer demand. To calculate the [ASP](https://revopsguide.net/glossary.html#average-sales-price-asp), you divide the total revenue generated from all sales by the total number of units sold.

For example, if a company sold 100 units of a product for a total of $10,000, the [ASP](https://revopsguide.net/glossary.html#average-sales-price-asp) would be $100 ($10,000 / 100 units). If the company then sold an additional 50 units at an average price of $125, the [ASP](https://revopsguide.net/glossary.html#average-sales-price-asp) would increase to $108 ($15,000 / 138 units).

The [ASP](https://revopsguide.net/glossary.html#average-sales-price-asp) can be a useful metric for identifying trends in customer demand and for adjusting pricing strategies as needed. It can also be used to compare the performance of different products or product lines and to benchmark the success of different pricing strategies.

It's important to note that the [ASP](https://revopsguide.net/glossary.html#average-sales-price-asp) is different from the average contract value (ACV), which measures the average revenue generated from a customer over the lifetime of their contract. ACV is typically used in B2B (business-to-business) sales, while [ASP](https://revopsguide.net/glossary.html#average-sales-price-asp) is more commonly used in B2C (business-to-consumer) sales.

### Average Revenue Per Customer (ARPC)

Average revenue per customer (ARPC) is a metric that measures the average amount of revenue generated from a customer over a given period of time. It is often used by businesses that rely on recurring revenue, such as subscription-based businesses, to evaluate the performance and value of their customer base.

To calculate ARPC, you divide the total revenue generated from customers in a given period of time by the number of customers. For example, if a business generates $100,000 in revenue from 100 customers in a month, the ARPC would be $1,000 ($100,000 / 100 customers).

ARPC can be a useful metric for businesses as it provides insight into the value of their customer base and can be used to identify trends in customer demand. It can also be used to compare the performance of different products or product lines and to inform pricing and customer acquisition strategies.

It's important to note that ARPC is different from average revenue per user (ARPU), which measures the average revenue generated from a user rather than a customer. ARPU is often used in the context of digital media and online services, while ARPC is more commonly used in the context of subscription-based businesses

### Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)

verage revenue per user (ARPU) is a metric that measures the average amount of revenue generated from a user over a given period of time. It is often used in the context of digital media and online services, such as social media platforms and gaming companies, to evaluate the performance and value of their user base.

To calculate ARPU, you divide the total revenue generated from users in a given period of time by the number of users. For example, if a social media platform generates $100,000 in revenue from 10,000 users in a month, the ARPU would be $10 ($100,000 / 10,000 users).

ARPU can be a useful metric for businesses as it provides insight into the value of their user base and can be used to identify trends in user engagement and demand. It can also be used to compare the performance of different products or product lines and to inform pricing and user acquisition strategies.

It's important to note that ARPU is different from average revenue per customer (ARPC), which measures the average revenue generated from a customer rather than a user. ARPU is often used in the context of digital media and online services, while ARPC is more commonly used in the context of subscription-based businesses.

### Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)

Related to: [Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)](https://revopsguide.net/glossary.html#monthly-recurring-revenue-mrr)

Annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a metric that measures the predictable and recurring revenue that a company receives from its customers on an annual basis. It is typically used by SaaS companies to evaluate the performance and growth of the business.

To calculate ARR, you simply take the total recurring revenue that a company receives from its customers in a given year and divide it by the number of months in that year. This includes recurring charges for subscription-based products or services, as well as any additional revenue that is generated on a recurring basis, such as usage-based fees or upsells.

ARR is a useful metric for tracking the growth and stability of a subscription-based business, as it provides insight into the predictable and recurring revenue that the company can expect to receive on an annual basis. It can also be used to forecast future revenue and to identify trends in customer demand.

There are several other related metrics that are often used in conjunction with ARR, such as monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and customer lifetime value (CLV). These metrics can provide additional insight into the performance and growth of a SaaS business.

### Customer Acquisition Cost ([CAC](https://revopsguide.net/glossary.html#customer-acquisition-cost-cac))

Customer acquisition cost ([CAC](https://revopsguide.net/glossary.html#customer-acquisition-cost-cac)) is a metric that measures the cost of acquiring a new customer for a business. It is an important metric for businesses that rely on customer acquisition for growth, as it can help to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of marketing and sales efforts.

To calculate [CAC](https://revopsguide.net/glossary.html#customer-acquisition-cost-cac), you divide the total cost of acquiring new customers in a given period of time by the number of customers acquired during that period. This includes all costs associated with acquiring new customers, such as marketing and advertising expenses, sales commissions, and any other costs related to the acquisition process.

For example, if a business spends $50,000 on marketing and sales efforts to acquire 100 new customers in a month, the [CAC](https://revopsguide.net/glossary.html#customer-acquisition-cost-cac) would be $500 ($50,000 / 100 customers).

Understanding [CAC](https://revopsguide.net/glossary.html#customer-acquisition-cost-cac) is important for businesses as it can help to identify areas for improvement in the customer acquisition process and to optimize marketing and sales efforts to maximize the return on investment. It can also be used to benchmark the performance of different marketing and sales channels and to compare the [CAC](https://revopsguide.net/glossary.html#customer-acquisition-cost-cac) of different products or product lines.

### Churn

Churn is a term used to describe the loss of customers in a business. It is a key metric for businesses that rely on recurring revenue, such as subscription-based businesses, as it can have a significant impact on the overall growth and stability of the business.

There are several different ways to measure churn, depending on the specific needs and goals of the business. Some common methods include:

- **Customer churn rate:** This is the percentage of customers who cancel their subscriptions or stop doing business with the company in a given period of time. It is calculated by dividing the number of customers who churn by the total number of customers at the beginning of the period.
- **Revenue churn rate:** This is the percentage of revenue that is lost due to churn in a given period of time. It is calculated by dividing the total revenue lost due to churn by the total revenue at the beginning of the period.
- **Gross churn rate:** This is the percentage of customers or revenue that is lost due to churn in a given period of time, before considering any new customer or revenue acquisition.
- **Net churn rate:** This is the percentage of customers or revenue that is lost due to churn in a given period of time, after considering any new customer or revenue acquisition.

Measuring churn is important for businesses that rely on recurring revenue, as it can help to identify trends in customer behavior and identify areas for improvement in the customer experience. By understanding the factors that contribute to churn, a business can take steps to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

### Cost Of Goods Sold (COGS)

Cost of goods sold (COGS) is a financial metric that measures the direct costs associated with producing and selling goods or services. It includes the cost of materials, labor, and other expenses directly related to the production or acquisition of goods or services. COGS does not include indirect expenses, such as marketing, sales, and administrative expenses.

COGS is an important metric for businesses as it provides insight into the efficiency and profitability of the business and can be used to identify areas for improvement in the production or sales process. It is often used in conjunction with other financial metrics, such as gross margin and net profit margin, to provide a more comprehensive view of the financial performance of a business.

To calculate COGS, you need to track the costs associated with producing and selling goods or services. This includes the cost of materials, labor, and any other direct expenses related to the production or acquisition of goods or services. COGS is typically calculated on a per-unit basis, and the total COGS for a given period of time can be calculated by multiplying the COGS per unit by the number of units sold.

It's important to note that COGS is not the same as operating expenses, which include indirect expenses such as marketing, sales, and administrative expenses. These expenses are typically excluded from the calculation of COGS.

In a SaaS business the typical COGS may include:

- **Materials and supplies:** This includes the cost of any materials or supplies required to produce or deliver the software, such as hardware, licenses, and other resources.

- **Labor costs:** This includes the cost of employee wages and benefits related to the production or delivery of the software, such as the salaries of engineers, developers, and other technical staff.

- **Data center and hosting costs:** This includes the cost of hosting and maintaining the software and related infrastructure, such as servers and data centers.

- **Subscription and license fees:** This includes the cost of any subscriptions or licenses required to use or access the software, such as software libraries or third-party tools.

- **Support and maintenance:** This includes the cost of providing technical support and maintenance services to customers, such as software updates and bug fixes.

- **Quality assurance:** This includes the cost of testing and quality assurance efforts related to the software, such as beta testing and user testing.

### Gross Margin

Gross margin is a financial metric that measures the profitability of a business by calculating the difference between the cost of goods sold (COGS) and the revenue generated from the sale of goods or services. It is expressed as a percentage of revenue and is used to evaluate the efficiency and profitability of a business.

To calculate gross margin, you subtract the COGS from the revenue and divide the result by the revenue. For example, if a business generates $100,000 in revenue and the COGS is $50,000, the gross margin would be 50% ($50,000 / $100,000).

Gross margin is an important metric for businesses as it provides insight into the profitability of the business and can be used to identify areas for improvement in the production or sales process. It is often used in conjunction with other financial metrics, such as net profit margin and operating margin, to provide a more comprehensive view of the financial performance of a business.

It's important to note that gross margin does not take into account other expenses, such as marketing, sales, and administrative expenses, which are included in other financial metrics, such as net profit margin and operating margin.

### Lifetime Value (LTV or CLV)

Customer lifetime value (CLV or LTV) is a metric that measures the total value that a customer is expected to generate for a business over the course of their relationship with the company. It is an important metric for businesses that rely on recurring revenue, as it can help to evaluate the long-term value of a customer and the overall health of the business.

To calculate CLV, you need to estimate the expected revenue that a customer will generate over their lifetime, as well as the expected costs associated with serving that customer. The difference between these two values is the CLV. There are several different approaches to calculating CLV, and the specific approach will depend on the characteristics of the business and its customer base.

Understanding CLV is important for businesses as it can help to identify the most valuable customers and to prioritize efforts to retain and grow those customers. It can also be used to evaluate the potential return on investment of different marketing and sales efforts and to inform pricing and customer acquisition strategies.

### Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

Related to: [Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)](https://revopsguide.net/glossary.html#annual-recurring-revenue-arr)

Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is a metric that measures the predictable and recurring revenue that a company receives from its customers on a monthly basis. It is typically used by SaaS companies to evaluate the performance and growth of the business.

To calculate MRR, you add up all the recurring revenue that a company receives from its customers in a given month. This includes recurring charges for subscription-based products or services, as well as any additional revenue that is generated on a recurring basis, such as usage-based fees or upsells.

MRR is a useful metric for tracking the growth and stability of a SaaS business, as it provides insight into the predictable and recurring revenue that the company can expect to receive on a monthly basis. It can also be used to forecast future revenue and to identify trends in customer demand.

There are several other related metrics that are often used in conjunction with MRR, such as average revenue per user (ARPU) and customer lifetime value (CLV). These metrics can provide additional insight into the performance and growth of a SaaS business.

### Net Promoter Score (NPS)

Net Promoter Score (NPS) is a metric used to measure customer satisfaction and loyalty. It is based on a simple question: "On a scale of 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our company to a friend or colleague?" Customers who respond with a score of 9 or 10 are considered "promoters," while those who respond with a score of 0 to 6 are considered "detractors." Customers who respond with a score of 7 or 8 are considered "passives."

To calculate NPS, you subtract the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters. The result is the NPS, which can range from -100 (all detractors) to 100 (all promoters).

NPS is a useful metric for businesses as it provides insight into customer satisfaction and loyalty and can be used to identify areas for improvement in the customer experience. It is often used as a benchmark for customer satisfaction and loyalty and can be a useful predictor of future growth.

There is no specific "good" or "bad" Net Promoter Score (NPS), as the interpretation of NPS results will depend on the specific industry and the expectations of the business. However, as a general rule of thumb, an NPS above 50 is generally considered to be good, while an NPS below 0 is generally considered to be poor.

It's important to note that NPS is just one metric and should be considered in the context of other customer satisfaction and loyalty metrics. A high NPS does not necessarily guarantee success, and a low NPS does not necessarily indicate failure. Instead, it is important to use NPS in conjunction with other metrics and to consider the specific needs and goals of the business.

### Payback Time

The payback time is the length of time it takes for an investment to generate sufficient returns to recover the initial investment. It is a measure of the return on investment (ROI) of an investment and is often used to evaluate the feasibility or risk of an investment.

To calculate payback time, you can follow the same general process as with any other investment: divide the initial investment by the expected annual cash flows from the investment. In a SaaS context the payback time usually refers to the time it takes for newly acquired customers to be profitable. The payback time is calculated by taking the initial investment, the customer acquisition cost ([CAC](https://revopsguide.net/glossary.html#customer-acquisition-cost-cac)) and dividing it by the Average Revenue per Customer (ARPC). For example, if the [CAC](https://revopsguide.net/glossary.html#customer-acquisition-cost-cac) $50,000 and the expected annual cash flows are $25,000, the payback time would be 2 years ($50,000 / $25,000).

Many SaaS companies give discounts when customers pay the first year upfront. This reduces the payback time, increases cashflow on often results in lower churn.
