# SaaS Glossary

There are many different key performance indicators (KPIs) that are important for SaaS companies to track and monitor. These KPIs can help to provide insights into the health and performance of the business, and can be used to identify areas for improvement or growth.

Here are some of the most important SaaS KPIs, along with a brief explanation of each one:

- **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):** This KPI measures the amount of revenue that is generated on a recurring basis from subscription fees, and is a key indicator of the overall health of the business.

- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** This KPI measures the cost of acquiring a new customer, and can help to identify the efficiency of the company's marketing and sales efforts.

- **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):** This KPI measures the total revenue that is generated from a customer over the course of their relationship with the company, and can help to identify opportunities for upselling or cross-selling.

- **Churn rate:** This KPI measures the percentage of customers who cancel their subscription or stop using the company's products or services, and can help to identify areas where the company is losing customers.

- **Net Promoter Score (NPS):** This KPI measures the degree to which customers are likely to recommend the company's products or services to others, and can provide insights into customer satisfaction and loyalty.

### Average Contract Value (ACV)

The average contract value (ACV) is a metric that measures the average revenue generated from a customer over the lifetime of their contract. It is often used to evaluate the performance of a sales team and to benchmark the success of different sales strategies. To calculate the ACV, you divide the total revenue generated from all contracts by the number of contracts.

For example, if a company generates $100,000 in revenue from 10 contracts, the ACV would be $10,000 ($100,000 / 10 contracts). If the company then generates an additional $50,000 in revenue from 5 new contracts, the ACV would increase to $11,000 ($150,000 / 15 contracts).

The ACV can be a useful metric for evaluating the effectiveness of a sales team and for identifying trends in customer demand. It can also be used to compare the performance of different sales teams or sales regions and to benchmark the success of different sales strategies.

It's important to note that the ACV is different from the average selling price (ASP), which measures the average price of a product or service that is sold. ACV is typically used in B2B (business-to-business) sales, where contracts are typically longer-term and involve a higher value, while ASP is more commonly used in B2C (business-to-consumer) sales, where transactions are typically smaller and more frequent.

### Average Sales Price (ASP)

The average selling price (ASP) is a metric that measures the average price of a product or service that is sold. It is often used to evaluate the overall pricing strategy of a company and to identify trends in customer demand. To calculate the ASP, you divide the total revenue generated from all sales by the total number of units sold.

For example, if a company sold 100 units of a product for a total of $10,000, the ASP would be $100 ($10,000 / 100 units). If the company then sold an additional 50 units at an average price of $125, the ASP would increase to $108 ($15,000 / 138 units).

The ASP can be a useful metric for identifying trends in customer demand and for adjusting pricing strategies as needed. It can also be used to compare the performance of different products or product lines and to benchmark the success of different pricing strategies.

It's important to note that the ASP is different from the average contract value (ACV), which measures the average revenue generated from a customer over the lifetime of their contract. ACV is typically used in B2B (business-to-business) sales, while ASP is more commonly used in B2C (business-to-consumer) sales.

### Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)

Annual recurring revenue (ARR) is a metric that measures the predictable and recurring revenue that a company receives from its customers on an annual basis. It is typically used by SaaS companies to evaluate the performance and growth of the business.

To calculate ARR, you simply take the total recurring revenue that a company receives from its customers in a given year and divide it by the number of months in that year. This includes recurring charges for subscription-based products or services, as well as any additional revenue that is generated on a recurring basis, such as usage-based fees or upsells.

ARR is a useful metric for tracking the growth and stability of a subscription-based business, as it provides insight into the predictable and recurring revenue that the company can expect to receive on an annual basis. It can also be used to forecast future revenue and to identify trends in customer demand.

There are several other related metrics that are often used in conjunction with ARR, such as monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and customer lifetime value (CLV). These metrics can provide additional insight into the performance and growth of a SaaS business.

### Churn

Churn is a term used to describe the loss of customers in a business. It is a key metric for businesses that rely on recurring revenue, such as subscription-based businesses, as it can have a significant impact on the overall growth and stability of the business.

There are several different ways to measure churn, depending on the specific needs and goals of the business. Some common methods include:

1. **Customer churn rate:** This is the percentage of customers who cancel their subscriptions or stop doing business with the company in a given period of time. It is calculated by dividing the number of customers who churn by the total number of customers at the beginning of the period.
2. **Revenue churn rate:** This is the percentage of revenue that is lost due to churn in a given period of time. It is calculated by dividing the total revenue lost due to churn by the total revenue at the beginning of the period.
3. **Gross churn rate:** This is the percentage of customers or revenue that is lost due to churn in a given period of time, before considering any new customer or revenue acquisition.
4. **Net churn rate:** This is the percentage of customers or revenue that is lost due to churn in a given period of time, after considering any new customer or revenue acquisition.

Measuring churn is important for businesses that rely on recurring revenue, as it can help to identify trends in customer behavior and identify areas for improvement in the customer experience. By understanding the factors that contribute to churn, a business can take steps to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

### Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) is a metric that measures the predictable and recurring revenue that a company receives from its customers on a monthly basis. It is typically used by SaaS companies to evaluate the performance and growth of the business.

To calculate MRR, you add up all the recurring revenue that a company receives from its customers in a given month. This includes recurring charges for subscription-based products or services, as well as any additional revenue that is generated on a recurring basis, such as usage-based fees or upsells.

MRR is a useful metric for tracking the growth and stability of a SaaS business, as it provides insight into the predictable and recurring revenue that the company can expect to receive on a monthly basis. It can also be used to forecast future revenue and to identify trends in customer demand.

There are several other related metrics that are often used in conjunction with MRR, such as average revenue per user (ARPU) and customer lifetime value (CLV). These metrics can provide additional insight into the performance and growth of a SaaS business.
