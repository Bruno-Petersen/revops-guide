# Systems Thinking

Systems thinking is a holistic approach that recognizes that complex systems often have emergent properties that cannot be fully understood by analyzing their parts in isolation. In a SaaS company, it can be used to optimize various business components and understand how they interact, as well as optimize processes and improve performance across the organization. It helps identify root causes of problems rather than just symptoms.
