# Queueing Theory

Queuing theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the analysis of systems that involve waiting in line, or "queues." It is used to model and analyze the performance of systems where there is a limited capacity for serving customers or processing requests, such as call centers, manufacturing plants, and computer systems.

In the context of process design, queuing theory can be used to optimize the flow of work through a system by identifying bottlenecks and determining the optimal capacity and resources needed to achieve desired levels of performance. For example, a call center might use queuing theory to determine the optimal number of call agents to hire and the best ways to route calls to minimize wait times and maximize customer satisfaction.

Queuing theory can be used to predict key performance indicators such as wait times, service rates, and utilization rates, and to optimize the design of systems to meet specific performance goals. It can also be used to analyze the trade-offs between different design choices, such as the cost of additional resources versus the benefits of improved performance.

## Queuing Theory and Theory of Constraints

Queuing theory and the theory of [constraints](/constraints.html) (TOC) are both frameworks that are used to analyze and optimize the performance of systems that involve the flow of work or resources. Both approaches can be used to identify bottlenecks or [constraints](/constraints.html) in a system and to determine how to optimize the flow of work to improve performance.

One key difference between the two approaches is that queuing theory is primarily focused on analyzing and predicting the performance of systems that involve waiting in line, or queues, while the theory of [constraints](/constraints.html) is focused on identifying and addressing the [constraints](/constraints.html) that limit the overall performance of a system.

In the theory of [constraints](/constraints.html), the goal is to identify the one or few [constraints](/constraints.html) that are limiting the performance of the entire system, and to focus on improving the capacity or efficiency of those [constraints](/constraints.html) in order to maximize the overall performance of the system. This may involve identifying ways to reduce waste or non-value-added activities, streamlining processes, or increasing the capacity of critical resources.

Queuing theory can be used in conjunction with the theory of [constraints](/constraints.html) to analyze and optimize the performance of systems that involve waiting in line, such as call centers or manufacturing plants. By combining the insights from both approaches, companies can identify and address both the queues and the [constraints](/constraints.html) that are limiting the performance of their systems.

## High Utilisation causes infinite waiting times

> A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.
