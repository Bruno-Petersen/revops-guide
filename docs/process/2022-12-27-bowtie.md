# The Bowtie Model

The Bowtie model is a framework that is often used to understand and analyze the business model of a SaaS company. It is called the Bowtie model because it visually represents the various components of a SaaS business as a bowtie shape. The Bowtie model can make SaaS businesses more comparable and predictable because it provides a consistent framework for analyzing and understanding the key components of a SaaS business.

Additionally, the Bowtie model can be useful for benchmarking and comparing SaaS businesses, as it provides a common language and framework for discussing and analyzing different aspects of the business. This can help companies understand how they compare to their peers and identify areas for improvement.

There are slight variations on the naming of stages within the Bowtie, but they generally start consist of 6 to 7 stages like the following:

- **Demand generation:** This stage refers to the strategies and tactics used to generate interest in the product or service, such as marketing campaigns and lead generation efforts. The goal of demand generation is to attract potential customers to the company's website or other marketing channels. This stages is sometimes called the _Awareness_ stage.

- **Demand capture:** This stage refers to the process of capturing the attention of potential customers and persuading them to provide their contact information or take other actions that indicate their interest in the product or service. This may include filling out a form on the company's website or signing up for a free trial. This stage is sometimes called the _Education_ stage.

- **Demand conversion:** This stage refers to the process of converting potential customers into paying customers. This may involve further nurturing and education of leads, as well as negotiations and closing of deals. This stage is sometimes called the _Selection_ stage and may consist of two distinct sections: qualification and closing with a handover in between.

- **Customer activation:** This stage, also known as customer onboarding, refers to the process of introducing new customers to the product or service and helping them get up and running with it. This may include training, support, and other onboarding activities. Sometimes called _onboarding_.
