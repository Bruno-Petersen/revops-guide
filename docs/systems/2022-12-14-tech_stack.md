# Tech Stack

A tech stack, or software stack, refers to the combination of technologies and tools that are used to build and run an application or system. It typically includes the operating system, programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and other components that are needed to develop and maintain the application.

A tech stack can be divided into different layers, each of which serves a specific purpose. For example, the following is a common web application tech stack:

- Operating system: The underlying platform on which the application runs.
- Web server: The software that handles incoming requests from clients and sends responses.
- Database: The system that stores and manages the application's data.
- Programming language: The language used to write the application's code.
- Framework: A set of libraries and tools that provide a standard structure for developing the application.
- Libraries and tools: Additional components that are used to build and maintain the application.
