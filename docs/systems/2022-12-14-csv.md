# CSV

A CSV file is essentially just a plain text file that contains data organized into columns and rows. It's called a "comma-separated values" file because each piece of data is separated by a comma, allowing for easy data manipulation and exchange. CSV files are often used for storing and sharing data, such as for a spreadsheet or database. They're simple, widely supported, and easy to work with, which is why they're so popular.

## Example JSON

Here's an example of how a CSV file might look when opened in a text editor:

```csv
ID,Name,Age,Gender
1,John Doe,32,Male
2,Jane Smith,25,Female
3,Bob Johnson,45,Male
```

As you can see, each line in the file is a record, with the individual values in the record separated by commas. The first line is often the header row, which contains labels for each of the columns in the file. In this example, the columns are "ID," "Name," "Age," and "Gender." Each subsequent line contains data for a different record, with the values in each record corresponding to the columns defined in the header row.

## Working with CSV files

There are many ways to interact with a CSV file, depending on your specific needs and goals. Some common ways to work with CSV files include:

- **Opening the file in a text editor** or spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, to view and edit the data directly
- **Using a program or script to read the data from the file** and process it in some way, such as importing it into a database or performing calculations on the data
- **Writing a program or script to generate a CSV file** from other data, such as exporting data from a database or programmatically creating a report

## Why CSV files are great to work with

Some of the main advantages of CSV files are:

- **Simplicity:** CSV files are plain text files, which makes them easy to create, edit, and share. They don't require any special software or tools to work with, and can be opened and edited with any text editor or spreadsheet program.
- **Compatibility:** CSV files are widely supported by a variety of programs and applications, which makes them easy to import and export data between different systems and platforms.
- **Flexibility:** CSV files are flexible, allowing users to define their own structure and format. This makes them suitable for a wide range of data types and scenarios.
- **Small size:** Because they use plain text and minimal formatting, CSV files are typically small in size, which makes them quick to download and easy to transfer.

## Working with CSV files in Python and JavaScript with the HubSpot API

Here's an example of using JavaScript to get the list of HubSpot users and write them to a CSV file.
I used this script to create a grouping of teams for our data warehouse.

```JavaScript
const fs = require("fs");
const request = require("request");

// Make the API Call
const getOwners = function (readKey, limit) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const options = {
      method: "GET",
      url: `https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/owners/?limit=${limit}`,
      json: true,
      auth: {
        bearer: readKey,
      },
      qs: {
        archived: "false",
      },
    };

    request(options, function (error, response, body) {
      if (error) throw new Error(error);
      if (response.statusCode == 200) {
        resolve(body);
      } else {
        reject(response.statusCode);
      }
    });
  });
};

// Extracting teams is only relevant in this use case
const extractTeams = function (data) {
  // generates a list of unique teams across all users
  const teams_raw = data.flatMap((user) => user.teams).filter((t) => t);

  function getUniqueListBy(arr, key) {
    return [...new Map(arr.map((item) => [item[key], item])).values()];
  }

  const unique = getUniqueListBy(teams_raw, "id").map((entry) => {
    return { id: entry.id, name: entry.name };
  });
  return unique;
};

const createCSV = function (data) {
  const fields = Object.keys(data[0]);
  const replacer = function (key, value) {
    return value === null ? "" : value;
  };

  const headlessCSV = data.map(function (row) {
    return fields
      .map(function (fieldName) {
        return JSON.stringify(row[fieldName], replacer);
      })
      .join(",");
  });

  headlessCSV.unshift(fields.join(",")); // add header column
  const csv = headlessCSV.join("\r\n");
  return csv;
};

const save = function (csv, fileName) {
  fs.writeFile(fileName, csv, (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(`${fileName} has been saved!`);
  });
};

const bearerToken = "-------"; // get the token here: https://app.hubspot.com/private-apps/YOUR_HUB_ID
const responseLimit = 500;
getOwners(bearerToken, responseLimit)
  .then((response) => {
    const cleanData = extractTeams(response.results);
    const csvData = createCSV(cleanData);
    save(csvData, "teams.csv");
  })
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));


```
