# Webhooks

A webhook is a way for one web application to provide other applications with real-time information. It allows one application to send a notification or trigger an action in another application, whenever a specific event or change occurs. This is different from the traditional way of polling for data, where an application periodically sends requests to another application to check for updates.

To use webhooks, one application (the "sender") exposes a URL that other applications (the "receivers") can use to register for notifications. Whenever a specific event or change occurs in the sender application, it sends a message to all registered receivers, providing them with the relevant information. The receivers can then take appropriate action, such as updating their own data or triggering a specific workflow.

Webhooks are often used in scenarios where real-time updates are important, such as in e-commerce or messaging applications. They can also be useful for integrating different applications or services, allowing them to communicate and share data in real-time. Overall, webhooks provide a flexible and efficient way for applications to share information and trigger actions in response to specific events.
