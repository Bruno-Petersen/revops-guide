# Webhooks

A webhook is a way for one web application to provide other applications with real-time information. It allows one application to send a notification or trigger an action in another application, whenever a specific event or change occurs. This is different from the traditional way of polling for data, where an application periodically sends requests to another application to check for updates.

To use webhooks, one application (the "sender") exposes a URL that other applications (the "receivers") can use to register for notifications. Whenever a specific event or change occurs in the sender application, it sends a message to all registered receivers, providing them with the relevant information. The receivers can then take appropriate action, such as updating their own data or triggering a specific workflow.

Webhooks are often used in scenarios where real-time updates are important, such as in e-commerce or messaging applications. They can also be useful for integrating different applications or services, allowing them to communicate and share data in real-time. Overall, webhooks provide a flexible and efficient way for applications to share information and trigger actions in response to specific events.

## Examplees

Some examples of how webhooks might be used in a B2B SaaS revenue operations context include:

- **Automating billing** and invoicing processes by triggering webhooks when a customer signs up for a subscription or when their subscription renews. This can help streamline the billing process and reduce the risk of errors.

- **Notifying customer success** teams when a customer's subscription is about to expire, so they can reach out and try to renew the subscription before it lapses. This can help prevent churn and keep revenue flowing.

- **Triggering webhooks when a customer upgrades or downgrades** their subscription plan, so the appropriate changes can be made to their account and billing information.

- **Sending notifications** to customer support teams when a customer reports a problem or issue with the SaaS product, so they can respond quickly and resolve the issue.

- **Sending notifications** to sales teams when a customer shows interest in upgrading their subscription, so they can follow up and try to close the deal.

- **Triggering webhooks when a customer cancels** their subscription, so the appropriate changes can be made to their account and billing information, and any necessary refunds can be processed.

- **Notifying account managers** when a customer's usage of the SaaS product exceeds a certain threshold, so they can reach out and offer additional support or resources if needed.
