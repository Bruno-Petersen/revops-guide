# JSON

If you are integrating tools, using an [API](https://revopsguide.net/apis.html) or [webhook](https://revopsguide.net/webhooks.html) or writing a script to automate a task you will come across JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a file format used all over the internet. JSON can be used in most modern programming languages, it is not tied to JavaScript, as the name might suggest.

You can identify JSON files through the `.json` extension, but you will likely just come across JSON in an API response or one of your tools.
When working in RevOps you will automate a task or build an integration sooner or later. That is when knowing the basics of JSON will make your task a lot easier.

In this post I will show you:

- What JSON looks like

- Strings vs. parsed JSON.
