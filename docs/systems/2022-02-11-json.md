# JSON

If you are integrating tools, using an [API](https://revopsguide.net/apis.html) or [webhook](https://revopsguide.net/webhooks.html) or writing a script to automate a task you will come across JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a file format used all over the internet. JSON can be used in most modern programming languages, it is not tied to JavaScript, as the name might suggest.

You can identify JSON files through the `.json` extension, but you will likely just come across JSON in an API response or one of your tools.
When working in RevOps you will automate a task or build an integration sooner or later. That is when knowing the basics of JSON will make your task a lot easier.

In this post I will show you:

- What JSON looks like
- The data types in JSON
- The structure of JSON
- Using and reading JSON

## Example JSON

Before we begin unpacking the differetn datatypes or the strucutre of JSON let us look at some example JSON that you might encounter.
Here is a shortened response from the HubSpot API. The data requested from the API, in this case, was a list of deal properties. This is the sort of information HubSpot usually displays to you in the property settings.

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "updatedAt": "2022-03-26T20:09:55.854Z",
      "createdAt": "2015-08-06T02:41:52.201Z",
      "name": "amount",
      "label": "Amount",
      "type": "number",
      "fieldType": "number",
      "description": "The total amount of the deal",
      "groupName": "dealinformation",
      "options": [],
      "displayOrder": 2,
      "calculated": false,
      "externalOptions": false,
      "hubspotDefined": true,
      "showCurrencySymbol": true,
      "modificationMetadata": {
        "archivable": true,
        "readOnlyDefinition": true,
        "readOnlyValue": false
      },
      "formField": false
    },
    {
      "updatedAt": "2022-01-14T20:45:56.577Z",
      "createdAt": "2015-08-06T02:41:52.364Z",
      "name": "closedate",
      "label": "Close Date",
      "type": "datetime",
      "fieldType": "date",
      "description": "The expected close date of the deal",
      "groupName": "dealinformation",
      "options": [],
      "displayOrder": 5,
      "calculated": false,
      "externalOptions": false,
      "hubspotDefined": true,
      "modificationMetadata": {
        "archivable": true,
        "readOnlyDefinition": true,
        "readOnlyValue": false
      },
      "formField": false
    }
  ]
}
```

- Strings vs. parsed JSON.
