# JSON

If you are integrating tools, using an [API](https://revopsguide.net/apis.html) or [webhook](https://revopsguide.net/webhooks.html) or writing a script to automate a task you will come across JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a file format used all over the internet. JSON can be used in most modern programming languages, it is not tied to JavaScript, as the name might suggest. JSON is also easy to read and write.

You can identify JSON files through the `.json` extension, but you will likely come across JSON in an API response or one of your tools.
When working in RevOps you will automate a task or build an integration sooner or later. That is when knowing the basics of JSON will make your task a lot easier.

This post will show you:

- What JSON looks like
- The data types in JSON
- The structure of JSON
- Using and reading JSON

## Example JSON

Before we begin unpacking the different datatypes or the strucutre of JSON let us look at some example JSON that you might encounter.
Here is a shortened response from the HubSpot API. The data requested from the API, in this case, was a list of deal properties. This is the sort of information HubSpot usually displays to you in the property settings.

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "updatedAt": "2022-03-26T20:09:55.854Z",
      "createdAt": "2015-08-06T02:41:52.201Z",
      "name": "amount",
      "label": "Amount",
      "type": "number",
      "fieldType": "number",
      "description": "The total amount of the deal",
      "groupName": "dealinformation",
      "options": [],
      "displayOrder": 2,
      "calculated": false,
      "externalOptions": false,
      "hubspotDefined": true,
      "showCurrencySymbol": true,
      "modificationMetadata": {
        "archivable": true,
        "readOnlyDefinition": true,
        "readOnlyValue": false
      },
      "formField": false
    },
    {
      "updatedAt": "2022-01-14T20:45:56.577Z",
      "createdAt": "2015-08-06T02:41:52.364Z",
      "name": "closedate",
      "label": "Close Date",
      "type": "datetime",
      "fieldType": "date",
      "description": "The expected close date of the deal",
      "groupName": "dealinformation",
      "options": [],
      "displayOrder": 5,
      "calculated": false,
      "externalOptions": false,
      "hubspotDefined": true,
      "modificationMetadata": {
        "archivable": true,
        "readOnlyDefinition": true,
        "readOnlyValue": false
      },
      "formField": false
    }
  ]
}
```

## Datatypes in JSON

The example above shows that JSON can store different kinds of information. Most programming languages distinguish different data types. These help the program understand how to interpret the data. Numbers, for example, can be used in arithmatic and boolean values can be used for logical operations. JSON has 6 basic data types. Four of these are primitive, simple types: `numbers`, `strings`, `booleans`, and `null`. The two others organise information, they are: `objects`, and `arrays`.

### Strings

A string is a sequence of zero or more characters. Strings use double quotes `" "` for demarkation. That means the string starts with the first, and ends with the second double quote. Here are some examples:

- `"This is a string that contains text"`
- `"strings can contain numbers 1239.34123 or consist of numbers only"`
- `"$1399.99"` `"100"` `"2015-08-06T02:41:52.364Z"`
- `"What matters are the double quotes!"`

Strings are very common. They usually hold text, but also commonly contain date information, we'll get to how to use date information in strings later.
Watch out for numbers that are strings. You will get errors or strange results trying to do math with strings.

### Numbers

in JSON numbers can use decimals, be positive or negative and use exponential E notation. For example:

- `200`
- `3.14159265359`
- `-273.15`
- `2.718e10`

Non-numbers like `NaN` (Not a Number) are not allowed. The use cases for numbers are unsurprising. One exception is the use of Unix timestamps to represent date information in seconds or milliseconds[^1]. The unix timestamp is the number of (mili)seconds since `00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970`. You can convert unix timestamps into human readable time in your code or using a website [like this one](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/).

- `1647123014` This is a timestamp in seconds
- `1647123014000` This is a timestamp in milliseconds

### Boolenas

Boolean values can either be `true` or `false`. Booleans are useful in logic and while programming since they allow you to write conditionals.[^2]
In the HubSpot example above we saw that booleans are used to record binary information about a property. E.g. `"hubspotDefined": true` indicates that this is a property created by HubSpot.

### Null

### Objects

### Arrays

## Things to watch out for

common JSON responses: arrays

- parsing
- Dates and times stored as strings or numbers (unix timestamp)
- Nesting and deep copies
- Strings vs. parsed JSON.

[^1]: Unix time also supports micro and nanoseconds, but that is a very unlikely use case in RevOps.
[^2]: Leaving JSON aside for a moment. You will find booleans being used with logical operators such as AND, OR and NOT often represented as `&&`, `||` and `!` respectively. Condition testing statements that start with `if` or `while` allow you to then put the boolen values to use.
