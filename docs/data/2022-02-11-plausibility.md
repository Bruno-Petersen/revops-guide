# Plausibility

Data analysis is an important part of making informed business decisions, as it can provide valuable insights into the performance and health of the company. However, it's important to carefully check the plausibility of the results from data analysis, as errors or inconsistencies in the data can lead to incorrect or misleading conclusions.

One of the key ways to check for the plausibility of data analysis results is to use data visualization tools, such as graphs or charts, to display the data. These tools can make it easier to identify patterns or trends in the data, and can help to highlight any potential errors or inconsistencies.

For example, if a data analysis shows a sudden spike in sales, it's important to check that this spike is plausible and not the result of an error in the data. By using data visualization tools, it's possible to quickly identify any unusual patterns in the data, and to dig deeper into the underlying data to understand the causes of these patterns.

Another important way to check for the plausibility of data analysis results is to compare the results with other data sources or external benchmarks. For example, if a data analysis shows that the company's customer satisfaction score has improved significantly, it's important to check that this improvement is consistent with other measures of customer satisfaction, such as online reviews or customer feedback surveys.

## Questions you can ask yourself

Here are some potential questions that you can ask to check whether the results of your analysis are plausible:

- Are the results consistent with other data sources or external benchmarks?
- Do the results align with your expectations or assumptions about the data?
- Are there any unusual or unexpected patterns in the data, such as sudden spikes or dips in performance?
- Are the results supported by a sufficient amount of data, or could they be the result of a small sample size?
- Are there any potential errors or inconsistencies in the data that could affect the accuracy of the results?
- Are the results in line with the overall trends or patterns that are typically seen in this type of data?
- Are the results robust and stable, or do they change significantly when different analytical methods or assumptions are used?

By asking these and other similar questions, you can help to identify potential issues with the plausibility of your data analysis results, and to ensure that the conclusions you draw from the analysis are accurate and reliable.
