Hi,
my name is Bruno and I work in Revenue Operations at [Funnel.io](https://funnel.io/) in Stockholm.

I originally worked in industrial process engineering and ended up in RevOps after building custom integrations at Funnel.

I started the revops guide for three reasons:

- to organise my thoughts around the work I do
- to improve at writing and web-development and
- to share what I have learned in the hope others may find it useful.

My goal is to make this site a useful source of information for anyone working in RevOps.  
Without fluff.

Reach out on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-petersen/) if you want to chat.
