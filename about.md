# About
Hi,
my name is Bruno and I work in Revenue Operations at [Funnel.io](https://funnel.io/) in Stockholm.

I originally worked in industrial process engineering and ended up in RevOps after building custom integrations at Funnel. 

The RevOps Guide is something I started because I've been missing a central place for information about revenue operations in SaaS. 
Writing the content myself also allows me to practice my web development skills. 

My goal is making this site a useful source of information for anyone working in RevOps. 
With no fluff.

Reach out to me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-petersen/) if you want to chat.
