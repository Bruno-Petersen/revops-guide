# About
Hi my name is Bruno and I work in Revenue Operations at Funnel.io in Stockholm.

I originally worked in industrial process engineering and ended up in RevOps after building custom integrations at Funnel for a while. 

The RevOps Guide is something I started because I've been missing a central place for information about revenue operations in SaaS. It also gives me an opportunity to practice my web develpment skills. 

There is a lot of great information out there, but that content is often geared towards other fields such as sales and marketing. My goal is to make this page a reliable source of information with no fluff for anyone working in RevOps.
